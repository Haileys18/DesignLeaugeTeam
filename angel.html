  <p><b>Why is this subject important to you?</b></p>
  <br>
  <p>This subject is important to me because it represents how resource efficient humans could be if we all put in the effort to. It also shows how much is really possible when everyone pitches in.</p>

  <p><b>What do you do for your team?</b></p>
  <br>
  <p>My job is to code the final design of our game, as well as go over what is posible using the tools availible to us. I use my knowledge of code to realize ideas, or fix anything that isn't realistically possible with our skills currently.</p>
